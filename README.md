Email crawler to find emails from a website.
For best usecase and to understand the crawling process, you can use the TigerCrawler.py which crawls and shows step by step crawling of the website and then provides email in the output.
On the other hand if you want emails directly you can use DirectCrawler.py which crawls in the backend using multiple thread workers and provides all the emails in the output.
